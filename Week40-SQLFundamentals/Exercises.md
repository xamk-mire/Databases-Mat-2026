## Exercise 1: TrailShop Project Task

This week you'll build the TrailShop database from scratch and practice manipulating data.

### Task 1.1: Create the Database

1. Open your PostgreSQL terminal (psql) or pgAdmin
2. Create a new database called `trailshop`
3. Connect to it

### Task 1.2: Create All Tables

Write and execute the CREATE TABLE statements for all six TrailShop tables in the correct order:

- categories
- customers
- products
- product_categories
- orders
- order_items

**Requirements:**

- Use appropriate data types for each column
- Include all constraints from the theory (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, FOREIGN KEY, DEFAULT)
- Use SERIAL for primary keys
- Ensure foreign keys reference the correct parent tables

**Verify** by running `\dt` in psql to list all tables.

### Task 1.3: Insert Sample Data

Insert the following data:

**Categories** (at least 5):

- Footwear, Backpacks, Tents, Clothing, Accessories

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

**Customers** (at least 5):

- Use easy to write names with realistic email addresses

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

**Products** (at least 10):

- At least 2 products per category
- At least one product assigned to **two or more** categories
- Prices ranging from €20 to €500
- Various stock levels

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

**Product categories:**

- Insert rows into `product_categories` so every sample product is linked to at least one category

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

**Orders** (at least 5):

- Different customers, different statuses

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

**Order Items** (at least 10):

- Multiple items in some orders, single items in others

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

**Verify** each insert with `SELECT * FROM table_name;`

### Task 1.4: Practice UPDATE

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended practice.** Do Tasks 1.4–1.6. They are not required to finish the TrailShop project. They prepare you for the exams. Task 1.6 renames `stock` to `quantity_in_stock`. Later weeks still use `stock`, so after you practice the rename, change the column name back.

Perform the following updates and verify each one:

1. Increase the price of all products in the Footwear category by 10% (join through `product_categories`)
2. Change customer #3's email to a new address
3. Update the status of order #2 from 'shipped' to 'delivered'
4. Set the stock of 'HydroFlask 1L' to 85
5. Add a description to any product that currently has NULL in description

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your queries here
>
>
> ```

### Task 1.5: Practice DELETE

1. Delete the most recently created order (and observe what happens to its order_items if you used CASCADE)
2. Try to delete a product that appears in `order_items` — what error do you get?
3. Delete a category that has products linked through `product_categories`. The products should remain; only the link rows should disappear. Confirm this.
4. Delete a customer who has no orders

### Task 1.6: Practice ALTER TABLE

1. Add a column `phone VARCHAR(20)` to the customers table
2. Add a column `weight_grams INTEGER` to the products table
3. Add a CHECK constraint to ensure `weight_grams > 0` (allow NULL though — not all products have weight recorded yet)
4. Rename the `stock` column in products to `quantity_in_stock`

## Exercise 2: Theory Review Questions

Answer the following questions in your own words using the answer fields below:

1. What does SQL stand for, and why was the language designed to look like English?

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

2. Explain the difference between DDL and DML. Give two example commands for each.

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

3. What is the difference between DCL and TCL? When would you use each?

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

4. Why must you create tables in a specific order? What determines that order?

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

5. What is the difference between a column-level constraint and a table-level constraint? When _must_ you use a table-level constraint?

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

6. Explain the difference between `DELETE FROM products;` and `TRUNCATE TABLE products;`. When would you prefer each?

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

7. What does `ON DELETE CASCADE` do on a foreign key? Give a real-world scenario where it's appropriate and one where it would be dangerous.

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

8. Why should you store `unit_price` in the `order_items` table instead of just looking it up from the `products` table?

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

9. What is the difference between SERIAL and GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY? Which would you use in a new project and why?

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your Answer_**
>
> _(Write your answer here.)_

10. Explain why `UPDATE products SET price = 9.99;` is dangerous. What steps should you take before running any UPDATE statement?

## Exercise 3: SQL Writing Exercises (Optional)

> [!TIP]

Write the SQL statements for each task in the **Your SQL** fields below. Verify by running them when ready.

### 3.1 CREATE TABLE

Write a CREATE TABLE statement for a `suppliers` table with the following columns:

- supplier_id (auto-incrementing primary key)
- company_name (required, max 200 characters, must be unique)
- contact_name (max 150 characters)
- email (max 255 characters, required, unique)
- phone (max 20 characters)

### 3.2 CREATE TABLE with Foreign Key

Write a CREATE TABLE statement for a `product_reviews` table:

- review_id (auto-incrementing primary key)
- product_id (required, references products)
- customer_id (required, references customers)
- rating (required integer, must be between 1 and 5 inclusive)

### 3.3 INSERT — Single Row

Write an INSERT statement to add a new category called 'Electronics' with description 'GPS devices, solar chargers, and tech gear'.

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

### 3.4 INSERT — Multiple Rows

Write a single INSERT statement that adds three new customers:

>
>
> ```

### 3.5 INSERT with RETURNING

Write an INSERT statement that adds a new product called 'NorthStar GPS' priced at €229.99 with stock of 12, then assign it to category 'Electronics' (assume `category_id = 6`) using `product_categories`. Return the product_id and created_at.

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

### 3.6 UPDATE — Simple

Write an UPDATE statement that changes the email of the customer with customer_id = 2 to 'mikko.korhonen@newmail.com'.

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

### 3.8 UPDATE — Multiple Columns

Write an UPDATE statement that changes order #3 to status 'cancelled' and sets a (hypothetical) cancelled_at timestamp to the current time. (Assume you've already added a cancelled_at column.)

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

### 3.9 DELETE — With Condition

Write a DELETE statement that removes all orders with status 'cancelled'.

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```

### 3.10 ALTER TABLE

Write the ALTER TABLE statements to:
a) Add a `discount_percent NUMERIC(5,2) DEFAULT 0 CHECK (discount_percent >= 0 AND discount_percent <= 100)` column to products
b) Drop the `description` column from categories
c) Add a composite unique constraint on (customer_id, product_id) in the product_reviews table (preventing a customer from reviewing the same product twice)

> [!NOTE]
> **_Your SQL_**
>
> ```sql
> -- Write your query here
>
>
> ```
